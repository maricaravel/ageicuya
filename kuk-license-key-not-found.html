Every time I tried to activate my license via the web GUI I would get a "license not found" error.

For those users This happened to me about a year ago and I just reminded of it thanks to my Snapchat memories. Thought it was a good one for here. We've got all the usual suspects for this one (Me, EP, EK) and one police officer (PO) So just over a year ago I spent every penny I had on a new (to me) convertible, my absolute pride and joy.

This is a long one. So a bit of backstory is needed for this one. My parents moved me across the country when I was 15, from California to Texas. We lived on the outskirts of a rich town and my mother had to drive me to school every day because the buses didn't come out our way. So I got a hardship drivers license, a beat up truck, and a part time job, I could drive to school, work and extra curriculars, thats it. I was having a hard time adjusting and making friends being moved right –î–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –≤–∞–º –∏—Å–∫–ª—é—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –≤ –æ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Ü–µ–ª—è—Ö.

I‚Äôm a 33 yr old black man living in Southern California (Orange County). I live with my wife (34, white) and two kids. We‚Äôve been together since we graduated H.S. and have experienced each other‚Äôs phases of life. One of these phases, included my wife obtaining a license plate frame with her first car at 19 while we were dating. She‚Äôs a redhead so I assumed this came with the territory. It reads: ‚Äú THE CLOSER YOU GET.THE SLOWER I GO ‚Äù. Over a decade Hello everyone, I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. I recently went on CrashDoge.com to try my luck. I am a gambling YouTuber with a channel called StackGambler. I deposited 5,000 Dogecoins with the intent of making 500,000 Dogecoins. https://gyazo.com/7f33a4ea076b54b766fc5703562c7dd1 (An image of the YouTube video I posted gambling on CrashDoge.) I successfully was able to make 1,000,000 Dogecoins. I attempted to withdraw, but there was only 250,000 in the hot wallet, which this is a long one, so buckle up. This happened back in 2017 when I was working as a security officer at a high-end Golf Course. We'll call it Fancy Golf Course (FGC) It was only a summer gig, but it paid well. And it gave me something to do for the summer while school was out. I had a really nice uniform, got handcuffs, and they even paid half of the price for my firearm, a 9 mm Ruger SR9. They were very good to me up until I was laid off because of major budget cuts. Mostly my job entailed. In DC you are allowed to officiate your own wedding, and you‚Äôre also not required to have any witnesses. As very private and low-key people, my then-fianc√© and I saw this as the perfect chance to get hitched without the stress, money, and crowds/noise of a traditional wedding. Last weekend we got up before dawn to beat the crowds at the DC Cherry Blossom Festival. We found a secluded spot and said our vows, just the two of us. It was perfectly intimate and a very special moment. Afterward 
It has been 15 years since Brianna Maitland was last seen leaving her job at the Black Lantern Inn in Montgomery, Vermont. Brianna was just 17 years old when she disappeared. Background : Brianna grew up on a rural farm in Vermont, near the Canadian border. In October 2003, Brianna moved out of her family home on her 17th birthday. Her parents, Kellie and Bruce Maitland, reported that there were no serious issues that led to her moving out, rather Brianna wanted more independence Hey, first time poster here with an ongoing situation that unfolded last night. Quick Background: beginning of 2018 I had a flat mate, let's call him Chad (because fuck chad), for a few months. I was very vulnarable at that time and unwilling to deal with my depression, I tried to have people around me as much as possible, so I wouldn't be alone. Being unemployed and with no social security money, I was eating away my savings one day at a time when a former friend (chad) came to me and offere. Long time lurker here. I just wanted to give something back and share what has worked for me. Not saying this is a panacea or universal formula. Just what has helped me achieve my goal. Backstory: I was a chubby kid. When I started high school, my dad had heart issues and the whole family switched to healtier food. That plus mandatory physical excercise classes got me to the end of high school in a reasonably good shape. Slightly overwheight but not obese, and able to do moderate ((This is a crosspost I put into WotB. At the suggestion of others, I put it here. Criticism welcome, ad hominem attacks are not)) Since DM is banned on Reddit, I'm going to Link here (https://twitter.com/williamcraddick/status/1106931601512910850) so you can get the story while posting the story down below. My commentary will follow: > An investigation and analysis by Disobedient Media indicates that Tarrant and the group he worked with likely have professional military connections 
In our group of friends, we (had) a CB who we had known since middle school. We were all in our mid 20's and starting our careers and families, while our CB friend lived in a one bedroom apartment paid for by her parents since she was 18. She was a messy girl who made a lot of depressing Facebook posts and seemed to always need attention, and seemingly had no desire to make her life better. But she was close with some of the girls in the group and always had been. She had never Storytime: I had been hopping freight trains from Oregon down to California, and ended up jumping off the boxcar in LA. I jumped off the train near Long Beach City, a total shit-hole of LA, and I just wanted to be somewhere else outside of LA, period. I was only a hitchhike away from San Diego, had never been there before, and so I decided to thumb my way south and check it out. It was my first time visiting San Diego. It was a beautiful city, not to mention the beautiful women: sunkissed. I just learned about privacytools.io this afternoon and started poking around at some of the software I hadn't heard of before. One in particular caught my eye: AES Crypt (https://www.aescrypt.com/). It's listed as "Worth Mentioning" under "File Encryption". I found some minor issues and one major issue. I only looked at the Linux version, written in C. However, most of the issues I highlight are relevant to all versions since it's part of the file format (https://www.aescrypt.com/aes_file_fo. Ok so this story happened a year ago today, but first some context:When I was about 14 I was walking home from a friends and I‚Äôm passing a little ditch, nothing too big and wasn‚Äôt too deep, when I hear crying not baby crying but kittens yelling for help, mind you these sounded like week old kittens, so I run on down and I find about a6 week old cat and his brother stuck in the water not able to touch the bottom, stuck in between some branches and stuff, so immediately I move the branches 
I have a bunch of old humble keys I can't use for anything, some might not work any more since most are a couple of years old. They are not steam-keys unless I write that they are. Forgot about bots, so I guess. Write what you want in the thread (let's start with like 5 per person tops) and I'll PM you the codes. Only sorted in oldest keys to newest, sorry about that. GIVEAWAY OVER! Everything has been taken. ~~King Arthur's Gold key redeemable on ~~King. Check out the Yelp reviews: https://www.yelp.com/biz/ballade-sports-garden-grove?sort_by=rating_asc Just had a bad experience with this shop. It seems this place went from the go to place in town to some pretty hit and miss reviews. They are banned on S2Ki and now seem to have a delinquent license with the State of California for auto repair. Alex is unwilling to return my ,500 deposit even though no repairs were preformed on my car. I found out much of the work he suggested didn't EDIT 2: Apparently they're using SKSE source code in violation of the license (https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/av4f5f/skyrim_together_is_stealing_skse_source_code/?ref=share&ref_source=link). This is a totally separate legal issue to whether or not they're violating a contract with Bethesda but isn't based on speculation, and is thus much more serious. EDIT: After discussing things with users I have some updates to make. Please keep in mind, I am not a lawyer TLDR: This is a basic rundown of the model and mission of Slang Worldwide. In it I present their brands, distribution, management, partnerships, and where they are headed. I‚Äôve written what I could with the information available to me and to the extent of my current knowledge. I‚Äôm a big fan of Slang and I believe they are set to be a very successful company in the long term. I have not invested in them yet, although I likely will be at some point and I'm just waiting to see their further. </p>
